class tsp_solver():
    ''' This class contains several methods for solving the TSP.
        most methods are meant only for internal use. This Class
        also provides multiple alternative ways to obtain a
        short graph, however it offers only heuristical methods,
        so the result will likely not be THE optimal graph.
        __________________________________________________________

        Heuristic approximations available are:
            
            - nearest neighbour
            - 2-opt

        planned:

            - 3-opt
            - k-opt (Kernighan - Lin)
            - genetic algorithm
